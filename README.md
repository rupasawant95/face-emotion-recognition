Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well. This technology is becoming more accurate all the time, and will eventually be able to read emotions as well as our brains do.  AI can detect emotions by learning what each facial expression means and applying that knowledge to the new information presented to it. Emotional artificial intelligence, or emotion AI, is a technology that is capable of reading, imitating, interpreting, and responding to human facial expressions and emotions.

# 2. Face Emotion Recognition Model

Facial expression recognition system is a computer-based technology and therefore, it uses algorithms to instantaneously detect faces, code facial expressions, and recognize emotional states. It does this by analyzing faces in images or video through computer powered cameras embedded in laptops, mobile phones, and digital signage systems, or cameras that are mounted onto computer screens. Facial analysis through computer powered cameras generally follows three steps:

A. Face detection

Locating faces in the scene, in an image or video footage.

B. Facial Feature Detection

Extracting information about facial features from detected faces. For example, detecting the shape of facial components or describing the texture of the skin in a facial area.

C. Facial expression and emotion Classification

Analyzing the movement of facial features and/or changes in the appearance of facial features and classifying this information into expression-interpretative categories such as facial muscle activations like smile or frown; emotion categories happiness or anger; attitude categories like (dis)liking or ambivalence
